Heap and Append-optimized Table Storage Formats
==================================================

|product_name| provides heap and append-optimized storage models. The storage model you choose depends on the type of data you are storing and the type of queries you are running. This section provides an overview of the two storage models and guidelines for choosing the optimal storage model for your data.

Heap storage
------------

By default, |product_name| uses the same heap storage model as PostgreSQL. Heap table storage works best with OLTP-type workloads where the data is often modified after it is initially loaded. ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` operations require storing row-level versioning information to ensure reliable database transaction processing. Heap tables are best suited for smaller tables, such as dimension tables, that are often updated after they are initially loaded.

Append-optimized storage
------------------------

Append-optimized table storage works best with denormalized fact tables in a data warehouse environment. Denormalized fact tables are typically the largest tables in the system. Fact tables are usually loaded in batches and accessed by read-only queries. Moving large fact tables to an append-optimized storage model eliminates the storage overhead of the per-row update visibility information. This allows for a leaner and easier-to-optimize page structure. The storage model of append-optimized tables is optimized for bulk data loading. Single row ``INSERT`` statements are not recommended.

To create a table with specified storage options
-----------------------------------------------------

Row-oriented heap tables are the default storage type.

.. code-block:: sql

   CREATE TABLE foo (a int, b text);

Use the ``WITH`` clause of the ``CREATE TABLE`` command to declare the table storage options. The default is to create the table as a regular row-oriented heap-storage table. For example, to create an append-optimized table with no compression:

.. code-block:: sql

   CREATE TABLE bar (a int, b text) 
       WITH (appendoptimized=true);

.. note::

   You use the ``appendoptimized=value`` syntax to specify the append-optimized table storage type. ``appendoptimized`` is a thin alias for the ``appendonly`` legacy storage option. |product_name| stores ``appendonly`` in the catalog, and displays the same when listing storage options for append-optimized tables.

``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` are not allowed on append-optimized tables in a repeatable read or serializable transaction and will cause the transaction to end prematurely.

Choose row or column-oriented storage
-------------------------------------

|product_name| provides a choice of storage orientation models: row, column, or a combination of both. This section provides general guidelines for choosing the optimal storage orientation for a table. Evaluate performance using your own data and query workloads.

-  **Row-oriented storage:** good for OLTP workloads with many iterative transactions and where many columns of a single row are needed at once, making retrieval efficient.
-  **Column-oriented storage:** good for data warehouse workloads with aggregations of data computed over a small number of columns or for single columns that require regular updates without modifying other column data.

For most general-purpose or mixed workloads, row-oriented storage offers the best combination of flexibility and performance. However, there are use cases where a column-oriented storage model provides more efficient I/O and storage. Consider the following requirements when deciding on the storage orientation model for a table:

-  **Updates of table data:** If you load and update table data frequently, choose a row-oriented heap table. Column-oriented table storage is only available on append-optimized tables.

-  **Frequent INSERTs:** If rows are frequently inserted into the table, consider a row-oriented model. Column-oriented tables are not optimized for write operations because column values for a row must be written to different places on disk.

- **Number of columns requested in queries:** If you typically request all or the majority of columns in the ``SELECT`` list or ``WHERE`` clause of your queries, consider a row-oriented model. Column-oriented tables are best suited to queries that aggregate many values of a single column where the ``WHERE`` or ``HAVING`` predicate is also on the aggregate column. For example:

   .. code-block:: sql

      SELECT SUM(salary) ...

   .. code-block:: sql

      SELECT AVG(salary) ... WHERE salary > 10000

   Or where the ``WHERE`` predicate is on a single column and returns a relatively small number of rows. For example:

   .. code-block:: sql

      SELECT salary, dept ... WHERE state='CA'

-  **Number of columns in the table:** Row-oriented storage is more efficient when many columns are required at the same time, or when the row size of a table is relatively small. Column-oriented tables can offer better query performance on tables with many columns where you access a small subset of columns in your queries.

-  **Compression:** Column data has the same data type, so storage size optimizations are available in column-oriented data that are not available in row-oriented data. For example, many compression schemes use the similarity of adjacent data to compress. However, the greater adjacent compression achieved, the more difficult random access can become, as data must be uncompressed to be read.

To create a column-oriented table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``WITH`` clause of the ``CREATE TABLE`` command specifies the table's storage options. The default is a row-oriented heap table. Tables that use column-oriented storage must be append-optimized tables. For example, to create a column-oriented table:

.. code-block:: sql

   CREATE TABLE bar (a int, b text) 
       WITH (appendoptimized=true, orientation=column);
