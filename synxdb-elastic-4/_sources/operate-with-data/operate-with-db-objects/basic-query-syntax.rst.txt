Basic Queries
=========================================

This document introduce the basic queries of |product_name|.

|product_name| is a high-performance, highly parallel data warehouse developed based on PostgreSQL and Greenplum. Here are some examples of the basic query syntax.

-  ``SELECT``: Used to retrieve data from databases & tables.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT * FROM employees;  -- Queries all data in the employees table.

-  Conditional query (``WHERE``): Used to filter result sets based on certain conditions.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;  -- Queries employee information with salary exceeding 50,000.

-  ``ORDER BY``: Used to sort query results by one or more columns.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;  -- Sorts employee information in descending order by salary.

-  Aggregation functions: such as ``COUNT``, ``SUM``, ``AVG``, ``MAX``, ``MIN``, used for calculating statistics from datasets.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;  -- Calculates the average salary of employees.

-  ``GROUP BY``: Used in conjunction with aggregation functions to group result sets.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;  -- Counts the number of employees by department.

-  Limit the number of results (``LIMIT``): used to limit the number of rows returned by the query result.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;  -- Only queries the information of the first 10 employees.

-  Join query (``JOIN``): used to combine data from two or more tables based on related columns.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
      FROM employees 
      JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;  -- Queries employees and their corresponding department names.

-  Subquery: Nested queries in another SQL query.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT name FROM employees 
      WHERE department_id IN (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');  -- Queries all employees working in New York.

The above is just a brief overview of the basic query syntax in |product_name|. |product_name| also provides more advanced queries and functions to help developers perform complex data operations and analyses.
