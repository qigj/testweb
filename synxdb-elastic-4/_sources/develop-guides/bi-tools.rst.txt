Supported BI tools
=====================

|product_name| is a cloud-native, storage-compute-separated database built on the Apache Cloudberry (Greenplum) kernel.

Any BI tool that supports Greenplum is also compatible with |product_name|. This includes, but is not limited to:

-  Tableau
-  Power BI
-  Looker
-  Apache Superset
-  Metabase
-  Qlik Sense

To set up and configure your preferred BI tool, follow the connection methods of :ref:`JDBC driver <develop-guides/jdbc-driver:use jdbc>` and :ref:`ODBC driver <develop-guides/odbc-driver:use odbc>`.

For further assistance, consult the documentation of your BI tool.
