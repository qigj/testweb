   * - Dimension
     - Apache Cloudberry
     - |product_name|
   * - Architecture
     - MPP (Massively Parallel Processing), tightly coupled compute and storage
     - Separation of compute and storage, stateless compute layer with elastic scaling
   * - Database kernel
     - Based on PostgreSQL 14, with enhancements
     - Uses Apache Cloudberry as the database kernel, modified for cloud-native architecture
   * - Scalability
     - Fixed cluster, scaling requires data redistribution
     - Elastic scaling, compute and storage layers expand independently
   * - Use cases
     - Suitable for on-premises big data analytics
     - Suitable for large-scale commercial customers, especially in cloud environments
   * - Deployment model
     - Traditional on-premises deployment
     - Kubernetes deployment
   * - Open-source / Commercial
     - Open-source, managed by Apache Foundation
     - Commercial, closed-source with additional enterprise features
