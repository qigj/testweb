# UNDROP TABLE

`UNDROP TABLE` restores a dropped table from the recycle bin.

## Synopsis

```sql
UNDROP TABLE <new_table_name> AS <recycle_bin_table_name>;
```

## Description

When a table is dropped, you can restore it within the data retention period using the `UNDROP TABLE` command. Before restoring, you must first query the system table `pg_recycle_bin` to find the unique name of the table in the recycle bin.

## Parameters

- `<new_table_name>`: The new name for the restored table.
- `<recycle_bin_table_name>`: The name of the table to be restored, as it exists in `pg_recycle_bin`.

## Examples

```sql
-- Assume table t1 was accidentally dropped.
DROP TABLE t1;

-- 1. Query the recycle bin for the unique name of the dropped table.
SELECT relname FROM pg_recycle_bin WHERE orig_relname = 't1';

-- Assume the query result is 't1_1678886400'.

-- 2. Use the retrieved name to restore the table and name it t1.
UNDROP TABLE t1 AS "t1_1678886400";
```
