The gp_toolkit Administrative Schema
====================================

|product_name| provides an administrative schema called ``gp_toolkit`` that you can use to query the system catalogs, log files, and operating environment for system status information. The ``gp_toolkit`` schema contains a number of views that you can access using SQL commands. The ``gp_toolkit`` schema is accessible to all database users, although some objects might require superuser permissions. For convenience, you might want to add the ``gp_toolkit`` schema to your schema search path. For example:

.. code:: sql

   => ALTER ROLE myrole SET search_path TO myschema,gp_toolkit;

This document describes the most useful views and user-defined functions (UDFs) in ``gp_toolkit``. You might notice other objects (views, functions, and external tables) within the ``gp_toolkit`` schema that are not described in this documentation (these are supporting objects to the views described in this section).

.. caution::

   Do not change database objects in the gp_toolkit schema. Do not create database objects in the schema. Changes to objects in the schema might affect the accuracy of administrative information returned by schema objects. Any changes made in the gp_toolkit schema are lost when the database is backed up and then restored with the ``gpbackup`` and ``gprestore`` utilities.

These are the categories for views in the ``gp_toolkit`` schema.

About the extension
---------------------------------------

``gp_toolkit`` is implemented as an extension in |product_name|. Because this extension is registered in the ``template1`` database, it is both registered an immediately available to use in every |product_name| database that you create.

Upgrade the extension
---------------------

The ``gp_toolkit`` extension is installed when you install or upgrade |product_name|. A previous version of the extension will continue to work in existing databases after you upgrade |product_name|. To upgrade to the most recent version of the extension, you must:

.. code:: sql

   ALTER EXTENSION gp_toolkit UPDATE TO '1.4';

in **every** database in which you use the extension.

Check for tables that need routine maintenance
----------------------------------------------

The following views can help identify tables that need routine table maintenance (``VACUUM`` and/or ``ANALYZE``).

-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_bloat_diag`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_stats_missing`

The ``VACUUM`` or ``VACUUM FULL`` command reclaims disk space occupied by deleted or obsolete rows. Because of the MVCC transaction concurrency model used in |product_name|, data rows that are deleted or updated still occupy physical space on disk even though they are not visible to any new transactions. Expired rows increase table size on disk and eventually slow down scans of the table.

The ``ANALYZE`` command collects column-level statistics needed by the query optimizer. |product_name| uses a cost-based query optimizer that relies on database statistics. Accurate statistics allow the query optimizer to better estimate selectivity and the number of rows retrieved by a query operation in order to choose the most efficient query plan.

gp_bloat_diag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This view shows regular heap-storage tables that have bloat (the actual number of pages on disk exceeds the expected number of pages given the table statistics). Tables that are bloated require a ``VACUUM`` or a ``VACUUM FULL`` in order to reclaim disk space occupied by deleted or obsolete rows. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see the tables that they have permission to access.

.. note::

   For diagnostic functions that return append-optimized table information, see `Check append-optimized tables <#check-append-optimized-tables>`__.

The columns of this view are described as follows:

-  ``bdirelid``: Table object id.
-  ``bdinspname``: Schema name.
-  ``bdirelname``: Table name.
-  ``bdirelpages``: Actual number of pages on disk.
-  ``bdiexppages``: Expected number of pages given the table data.
-  ``bdidiag``: Bloat diagnostic message.

gp_stats_missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This view shows tables that do not have statistics and therefore might require an ``ANALYZE`` be run on the table.

The columns of this view are described as follows:

-  ``smischema``: Schema name.
-  ``smitable``: Table name.
-  ``smisize``: Does this table have statistics? False if the table does not have row count and row sizing statistics recorded in the system catalog, which might indicate that the table needs to be analyzed. This will also be false if the table does not contain any rows. For example, the parent tables of partitioned tables are always empty and will always return a false result.
-  ``smicols``: Number of columns in the table.
-  ``smirecs``: The total number of columns in the table that have
   statistics recorded.

Check for locks
---------------

When a transaction accesses a relation (such as a table), it acquires a lock. Depending on the type of lock acquired, subsequent transactions might have to wait before they can access the same relation. For more information on the types of locks, see the `Transaction <..>`__. |product_name| resource queues (used for resource management) also use locks to control the admission of queries into the system.

The ``gp_locks_*`` family of views can help diagnose queries and sessions that are waiting to access an object due to a lock.

- :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_locks_on_relation`
- :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_locks_on_resqueue`

gp_locks_on_relation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This view shows any locks currently being held on a relation, and the associated session information about the query associated with the lock. For more information on the types of locks, see the `Transaction <..>`__. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see the locks for relations that they have permission to access.

The columns of this view are described as follows:

-  ``lorlocktype``: Type of the lockable object: ``relation``, ``extend``, ``page``, ``tuple``, ``transactionid``, ``object``, ``userlock``, ``resource queue``, or ``advisory``.
-  ``lordatabase``: Object ID of the database in which the object exists, zero if the object is a shared object.
-  ``lorrelname``: The name of the relation.
-  ``lorrelation``: The object ID of the relation.
-  ``lortransaction``: The transaction ID that is affected by the lock.
-  ``lorpid``: Process ID of the server process holding or awaiting this lock. ``NULL`` if the lock is held by a prepared transaction.
-  ``lormode``: Name of the lock mode held or desired by this process.
-  ``lorgranted``: Displays whether the lock is granted (``true``) or not granted (``false``).
-  ``lorcurrentquery``: The current query in the session.

gp_locks_on_resqueue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The ``gp_locks_on_resqueue`` view is valid only when resource queue-based resource management is active.

This view shows any locks currently being held on a resource queue, and the associated session information about the query associated with the lock. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see the locks associated with their own sessions.

The columns of this view are described as follows:

-  ``lorusename``: Name of the user running the session.
-  ``lorrsqname``: The resource queue name.

-  ``lorgranted``: Displays whether the lock is granted (``true``) or not granted (``false``).
-  ``lorwaiteventtype``: The type of waiting event (for example, I/O, lock, network).
-  ``lorwaitevent``: The name or description of the waiting event (for example, the I/O operation or lock object of a file).

Check append-optimized tables
-----------------------------

The ``gp_toolkit`` schema includes a set of diagnostic functions you can use to investigate the state of append-optimized tables.

When an append-optimized table (or column-oriented append-optimized table) is created, another table is implicitly created, containing metadata about the current state of the table. The metadata includes information such as the number of records in each of the table's segments.

Append-optimized tables might have non-visible rowsâ€”rows that have been updated or deleted, but remain in storage until the table is compacted using ``VACUUM``. The hidden rows are tracked using an auxiliary visibility map table, or visimap.

The following functions let you access the metadata for append-optimized and column-oriented tables and view non-visible rows.

For most of the functions, the input argument is ``regclass``, either the table ``name`` or the ``oid`` of a table.

__gp_aovisimap_compaction_info(oid)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function displays compaction information for an append-optimized table. The information is for the on-disk data files on database segments that store the table data. You can use the information to determine the data files that will be compacted by a ``VACUUM`` operation on an append-optimized table.

.. note::

   Until a ``VACUUM`` operation deletes the row from the data file, deleted or updated data rows occupy physical space on disk even though they are hidden to new transactions. The configuration parameter ``gp_appendonly_compaction`` controls the functionality of the ``VACUUM`` command.

This table describes the ``__gp_aovisimap_compaction_info`` function output table. The columns of this table are described as follows:

-  ``content``: Database segment ID.
-  ``datafile``: ID of the data file on the segment.
-  ``compaction_possible``: The value is either ``t`` or ``f``. The value ``t`` indicates that the data in data file be compacted when a VACUUM operation is performed. The server configuration parameter ``gp_appendonly_compaction_threshold`` affects this value.
-  ``hidden_tupcount``: In the data file, the number of hidden (deleted or updated) rows.
-  ``total_tupcount``: In the data file, the total number of rows.
-  ``percent_hidden``: In the data file, the ratio (as a percentage) of hidden (deleted or updated) rows to total rows.

Check server configuration files
--------------------------------

Each component of a |product_name| system (coordinator, standby coordinator, primary segments, and mirror segments) has its own server configuration file (``postgresql.conf``). The following ``gp_toolkit`` objects can be used to check parameter settings across all primary ``postgresql.conf`` files in the system:

-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_param_setting('parameter_name')`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_param_settings_seg_value_diffs`

gp_param_setting('parameter_name')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function takes the name of a server configuration parameter and returns the ``postgresql.conf`` value for the coordinator and each active segment. This function is accessible to all users. The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``paramsegment``: The segment content id (only active segments are shown). The coordinator content id is always -1.
-  ``paramname``: The name of the parameter.
-  ``paramvalue``: The value of the parameter.

Example:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_param_setting('max_connections');

gp_param_settings_seg_value_diffs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Server configuration parameters that are classified as *local* parameters (meaning each segment gets the parameter value from its own ``postgresql.conf`` file), should be set identically on all segments. This view shows local parameter settings that are inconsistent. Parameters that are supposed to have different values (such as ``port``) are not included. This view is accessible to all users.

The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``psdname``: The name of the parameter.
-  ``psdvalue``: The value of the parameter.
-  ``psdcount``: The number of segments that have this value.

Check for failed segments
-------------------------

The :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_pgdatabase_invalid` view can be used to check for down segments.

gp_pgdatabase_invalid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This view shows information about segments that are marked as down in the system catalog. This view is accessible to all users. The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``pgdbidbid``: The segment dbid. Every segment has a unique dbid.
-  ``pgdbiisprimary``: Is the segment currently acting as the primary (active) segment? (t or f).
-  ``pgdbicontent``: The content id of this segment. A primary and mirror will have the same content id.
-  ``pgdbivalid``: Is this segment up and valid? (t or f).
-  ``pgdbidefinedprimary``: Was this segment assigned the role of primary at system initialization time? (t or f).

Check resource group activity and status
----------------------------------------

.. note::

   The resource group activity and status views described in this section are valid only when resource group-based resource management is active.

Resource groups manage transactions to avoid exhausting system CPU and memory resources. Every database user is assigned a resource group. |product_name| evaluates every transaction submitted by a user against the limits configured for the user's resource group before running the transaction.

You can use the ``gp_resgroup_config`` view to check the configuration of each resource group. You can use the ``gp_resgroup_status*`` views to display the current transaction status and resource usage of each resource group.

gp_resgroup_config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_resgroup_config`` view allows administrators to see the current CPU, memory, and concurrency limits for a resource group.

This view is accessible to all users. The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``groupid``: The ID of the resource group.
-  ``groupname``: The name of the resource group.
-  ``concurrency``: The concurrency (``CONCURRENCY``) value specified for the resource group.
-  ``cpu_max_percent``: The CPU limit (``CPU_MAX_PERCENT``) value specified for the resource group, or ``-1``.

gp_resgroup_status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_resgroup_status`` view allows administrators to see status and activity for a resource group. It shows how many queries are waiting to run and how many queries are currently active in the system for each resource group. The view also displays current memory and CPU usage for the resource group.

.. note::

   Resource groups use the Linux control groups (cgroups) configured on the host systems. The cgroups are used to manage host system resources. When resource groups use cgroups that are as part of a nested set of cgroups, resource group limits are relative to the parent cgroup allotment. For information about nested cgroups and |product_name| resource group limits, see the *Use Resource Groups* document.

This view is accessible to all users. The columns of the view are
described as follows:

-  ``groupid``: The ID of the resource group.
-  ``groupname``: The name of the resource group.
-  ``num_running``: The number of transactions currently running in the resource group.
-  ``num_queueing``: The number of currently queued transactions for the resource group.
-  ``num_queued``: The total number of queued transactions for the resource group since the |product_name| cluster was last started, excluding the num_queueing.
-  ``num_executed``: The total number of transactions run in the resource group since the |product_name| cluster was last started, excluding the num_running.
-  ``total_queue_duration``: The total time any transaction was queued since the |product_name| cluster was last started.

Sample output for the ``gp_resgroup_status`` view:

.. code:: sql

   select * from gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_status;

   groupid | groupname | num_running | num_queueing | num_queued | num_executed | total_queue_duration 
   ---------+-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+--------------+----------------------
   (0 rows)

gp_resgroup_status_per_host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_resgroup_status_per_host`` view displays the real-time CPU and memory usage (MBs) for each resource group on a per-host basis. The view also displays available and granted group fixed and shared memory for each resource group on a host.

Sample output for the ``gp_resgroup_status_per_host`` view:

.. code:: sql

   select * from gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_status_per_host;

   groupid | groupname | hostname | cpu_usage | memory_usage 
   ---------+-----------+----------+-----------+--------------
   (0 rows)

gp_resgroup_status_per_segment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_status_per_segment`` view shows memory usage by resource group on each segment. The statistics are reported by the vmem tracker and measured in MB. This view helps database administrators monitor memory consumption of resource groups across segments.

.. note::

   This view is available only when resource group-based resource management is enabled.

Column descriptions:

-  ``groupid`` (type: ``oid``): Unique identifier of the resource group, corresponding to ``pg_resgroup.oid``.
-  ``groupname`` (type: ``name``): Name of the resource group, corresponding to ``pg_resgroup.rsgname``.

-  ``vmem_usage`` (type: ``smallint``): Real-time memory usage (in MB) of the resource group on the corresponding segment.

Check resource queue activity and status
----------------------------------------

.. note::

   The resource queue activity and status views described in this section are valid only when resource queue-based resource management is active.

The purpose of resource queues is to limit the number of active queries in the system at any given time in order to avoid exhausting system resources such as memory, CPU, and disk I/O. All database users are assigned to a resource queue, and every statement submitted by a user is first evaluated against the resource queue limits before it can run. The ``gp_resq_*`` family of views can be used to check the status of statements currently submitted to the system through their respective resource queue. Note that statements issued by superusers are exempt from resource queuing.

Check query disk spill space usage
----------------------------------

The *gp_workfile\_* views show information about all the queries that are currently using disk spill space. |product_name| creates work files on disk if it does not have sufficient memory to run the query in memory. This information can be used for troubleshooting and tuning queries. The information in the views can also be used to specify the values for the |product_name| configuration parameters ``gp_workfile_limit_per_query`` and ``gp_workfile_limit_per_segment``.

-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_workfile_entries`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_workfile_usage_per_query`

View users and groups (roles)
-----------------------------

It is frequently convenient to group users (roles) together to ease management of object privileges: that way, privileges can be granted to, or revoked from, a group as a whole. In |product_name|, this is done by creating a role that represents the group, and then granting membership in the group role to individual user roles.

The :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_roles_assigned` view can be used to see all of the roles in the system, and their assigned members (if the role is also a group role).

gp_roles_assigned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This view shows all of the roles in the system, and their assigned members (if the role is also a group role). This view is accessible to all users.

The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``raroleid``: The role object ID. If this role has members (users), it is considered a *group* role.
-  ``rarolename``: The role (user or group) name.
-  ``ramemberid``: The role object ID of the role that is a member of this role.
-  ``ramembername``: Name of the role that is a member of this role.

Check database object sizes and disk space
------------------------------------------

The ``gp_size_*`` family of views can be used to determine the disk space usage for a distributed |product_name| database, schema, table, or index. The following views calculate the total size of an object across all primary segments (mirrors are not included in the size calculations).

-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_size_of_all_table_indexes`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_size_of_database`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_size_of_index`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_size_of_schema_disk`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_size_of_table_and_indexes_disk`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_size_of_table_and_indexes_licensing`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_size_of_table_disk`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_size_of_table_uncompressed`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_disk_free`

The table and index sizing views list the relation by object ID (not by name). To check the size of a table or index by name, you must look up the relation name (``relname``) in the ``pg_class`` table. For example:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT relname as name, sotdsize as size, sotdtoastsize as 
   toast, sotdadditionalsize as other 
   FROM gp_size_of_table_disk as sotd, pg_class

Check for missing and orphaned data files
-----------------------------------------

|product_name| considers a relation data file that is present in the catalog, but not on disk, to be missing. Conversely, when |product_name| encounters an unexpected data file on disk that is not referenced in any relation, it considers that file to be orphaned.

|product_name| provides the following views to help identify if missing or orphaned files exist in the current database:

-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_check_orphaned_files`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_check_missing_files`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_check_missing_files_ext`

Consider it a best practice to check for these conditions prior to expanding the cluster or before offline maintenance.

By default, the views identified in this section are available to ``PUBLIC``.

gp_check_orphaned_files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_check_orphaned_files`` view scans the default and user-defined tablespaces for orphaned data files. |product_name| considers normal data files, files with an underscore (``_``) in the name, and extended numbered files (files that contain a ``.<N>`` in the name) in this check. ``gp_check_orphaned_files`` gathers results from the |product_name| coordinator and all segments.

The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``gp_segment_id``: The database segment identifier.
-  ``tablespace``: The identifier of the tablespace in which the orphaned file resides.
-  ``filename``: The file name of the orphaned data file.
-  ``filepath``: The file system path of the orphaned data file, relative to the data directory of the coordinator or segment.

.. caution::

   Use this view as one of many data points to identify orphaned data files. Do not delete files based solely on results from querying this view.

gp_check_missing_files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_check_missing_files`` view scans heap and append-optimized, column-oriented tables for missing data files. |product_name| considers only normal data files (files that do not contain a ``.`` or an ``_`` in the name) in this check. ``gp_check_missing_files`` gathers results from the |product_name| coordinator and all segments.

The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``gp_segment_id``: The database segment identifier.
-  ``tablespace``: The identifier of the tablespace in which the table resides.
-  ``relname``: The name of the table that has a missing data file(s).
-  ``filename``: The file name of the missing data file.

gp_check_missing_files_ext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_check_missing_files_ext`` view scans only append-optimized, column-oriented tables for missing extended data files. |product_name| considers both normal data files and extended numbered files (files that contain a ``.<N>`` in the name) in this check. Files that contain an ``_`` in the name are not considered. ``gp_check_missing_files_ext`` gathers results from the |product_name| database segments only.

The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``gp_segment_id``: The database segment identifier.
-  ``tablespace``: The identifier of the tablespace in which the table resides.
-  ``relname``: The name of the table that has a missing extended data file(s).
-  ``filename``: The file name of the missing extended data file.

Move orphaned data files
------------------------

The ``gp_move_orphaned_files()`` user-defined function (UDF) moves orphaned files found by the :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_check_orphaned_files` view into a file system location that you specify.

The function signature is: ``gp_move_orphaned_files( <target_directory> TEXT )``.

``<target_directory>`` must exist on all segment hosts before you move the files, and the specified directory must be accessible by the ``gpadmin`` user. If you specify a relative path for ``<target_directory>``, it is considered relative to the data directory of the coordinator or segment.

|product_name| renames each moved data file to one that reflects the original location of the file in the data directory. The file name format differs depending on the tablespace in which the orphaned file resides:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{mytable-mid}

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left
   :widths: 8 18

   *  - Tablespace
      - Renamed file format
   *  - ``default``
      - ``seg<num>_base_<database-oid>_<relfilenode>``
   *  - ``global``
      - ``seg<num>_global_<relfilenode>``
   *  - ``user-defined``
      - ``seg<num>_pg_tblspc_<tablespace-oid>_<gpdb-version>_<database-oid>_<relfilenode>``

.. raw:: latex

   \end{mytable-mid}

For example, if a file named ``12345`` in the default tablespace is orphaned on primary segment 2,

.. code:: sql

   SELECT * FROM gp_move_orphaned_files('/home/gpadmin/orphaned');

moves and renames the file as follows:

-  original location: ``<data_directory>/base/13700/12345``
-  new location and file name: ``/home/gpadmin/orphaned/seg2_base_13700_12345``

``gp_move_orphaned_files()`` returns both the original and the new file system locations for each file that it moves, and also provides an indication of the success or failure of the move operation. For example:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_move_orphaned_files('/home/gpadmin/orphaned');

Once you move the files, you might choose to remove them or to back them up.

Check for uneven data distribution
----------------------------------

All tables in |product_name| are distributed, meaning their data is divided across all of the segments in the system. If the data is not distributed evenly, then query processing performance might decrease. The following views can help diagnose if a table has uneven data distribution:

-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_skew_coefficients`
-  :ref:`references/sys-catalog/gp-toolkit-schema:gp_skew_idle_fractions`

gp_skew_coefficients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This view shows data distribution skew by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) for the data stored on each segment. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see tables that they have permission to access.

The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``skcoid``: The object id of the table.
-  ``skcnamespace``: The namespace where the table is defined.
-  ``skcrelname``: The table name.
-  ``skccoeff``: The coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated as the standard deviation divided by the average. It takes into account both the average and variability around the average of a data series. The lower the value, the better. Higher values indicate greater data skew.

gp_skew_idle_fractions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This view shows data distribution skew by calculating the percentage of the system that is idle during a table scan, which is an indicator of processing data skew. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see tables that they have permission to access.

The columns of the view are described as follows:

-  ``sifoid``: The object id of the table.
-  ``sifnamespace``: The namespace where the table is defined.
-  ``sifrelname``: The table name.
-  ``siffraction``: The percentage of the system that is idle during a table scan, which is an indicator of uneven data distribution or query processing skew. For example, a value of ``0.1`` indicates 10% skew, a value of ``0.5`` indicates 50% skew, and so on. Tables that have more than 10% skew should have their distribution policies evaluated.

Maintain partitions
-------------------

If your database employs partitions you will need to perform certain tasks regularly to help maintain those partitions. |product_name| includes a view and a number of user-defined functions to help with these tasks.

The gp_partitions view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_partitions`` view shows all leaf partitions in a database.

This view provides backwards compatibility with the legacy ``pg_partitions`` view (available in earlier major versions of |product_name|). The columns of the view are described as follows:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{mytable-mid}

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left
   :widths: 10 8 15

   *  - Column
      - Type
      - Description

      - The relation name of the parent table one level up from this partition.
   *  - ``partitiontype``
      - text
      - The type of partition (range or list).

      - For range partitions, the rank of the partition compared to other partitions of the same level.
   *  - ``partitionlistvalues``
      - text
      - For list partitions, the list value(s) associated with this partition.

      - For range partitions, the start value of this partition.
   *  - ``partitionrangeend``
      - text
      - For range partitions, the end value of this partition.
   *  - ``partitionisdefault``
      - boolean
      - T if this is a default partition, otherwise F.
   *  - ``partitionboundary``
      - text
      - The entire partition specification for this partition.
   *  - ``parenttablespace``
      - name
      - The tablespace of the parent table one level up from this partition.
   *  - ``partitiontablespace``
      - name
      - The tablespace of this partition.

User-defined functions for partition maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table summarizes the functions |product_name| provides to help you maintain partitions:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{mytable-mid}

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left
   :widths: 10 15 20

   *  - Function
      - Return type
      - Description
   *  - ``pg_partition_rank(rp regclass)``
      - integer
      - For range partitions, returns the rank of the partition compared to other partitions of the same level. For other partition types, it returns ``NULL``.
   *  - ``pg_partition_range_from(rp regclass)``
      - text
      - Returns the lower bound of a range partition.
   *  - ``pg_partition_range_to(rp regclass)``
      - text
      - Returns the upper bound of a range partition.
   *  - ``pg_partition_isdefault(rp regclass)``
      - boolean
      - Evaluates whether a given partition is a default partition.
   *  - ``pg_partition_lowest_child(rp regclass)``
      - regclass
      - Finds the lowest ranked child of given partition.
   *  - ``pg_partition_highest_child(rp regclass)``
      - regclass
      - Finds the highest ranked child of given partition.
