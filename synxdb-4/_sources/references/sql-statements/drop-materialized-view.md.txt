# DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW

Removes a materialized view.

## Synopsis

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] <name> [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` drops an existing materialized view. To run this command, you must be the owner of the materialized view.

## Parameters

**`IF EXISTS`**

Do not throw an error if the materialized view does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

**`name`**

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a materialized view to be dropped.

**`CASCADE`**

Automatically drop objects that depend on the materialized view (such as other materialized views, or regular views), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects.

**`RESTRICT`**

Refuse to drop the materialized view if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

This command removes the materialized view called `order_summary`.

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW order_summary;
```

## Compatibility

`DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` is a {{ product_name }} extension of the SQL standard.
