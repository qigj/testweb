Backup and Restore Overview
===========================

|product_name| offers both parallel and non-parallel methods for database backups and restores. Parallel operations handle large systems efficiently because each segment host writes data to its local disk at the same time. Non-parallel operations, however, transfer all data over the network to the coordinator, which then writes it to its storage. This method not only concentrates I/O on a single host but also requires the coordinator to have enough local disk space for the entire database.

Parallel backup with ``gpbackup`` and ``gprestore``
---------------------------------------------------

|product_name| provides ``gpbackup`` and ``gprestore`` for parallel backup and restore utilities. ``gpbackup`` uses table-level ``ACCESS SHARE`` locks instead of ``EXCLUSIVE`` locks on the ``pg_class`` catalog table. This enables you to execute DDL statements such as ``CREATE``, ``ALTER``, ``DROP``, and ``TRUNCATE`` during backups, as long as these statements do not target the current backup set.

Backup files created with ``gpbackup`` are designed to provide future capabilities for restoring individual database objects along with their dependencies, such as functions and required user-defined data types.

For details about backup and restore using ``gpbackup`` and ``gprestore``, see :ref:`manage-system/backup-and-restore/full-backup-and-restore:perform full backup and restore` and :ref:`manage-system/backup-and-restore/incremental-backup-and-restore:perform incremental backup and restore`.

         --with-stats                   Restore query plan statistics

Non-parallel backup with ``pg_dump``
------------------------------------

You can also use the PostgreSQL non-parallel backup utilitiesm\ ``pg_dump`` and ``pg_dumpall`` to create a single dump file on the coordinator host that contains all data from all active segments.

The PostgreSQL non-parallel utilities should be used only for special cases. They are much slower than using ``gpbackup`` and ``gprestore`` because all of the data must pass through the coordinator. In addition, it is often the case that the coordinator host has insufficient disk space to save a backup of an entire distributed |product_name|.

The ``pg_restore`` utility requires compressed dump files created by ``pg_dump`` or ``pg_dumpall``. Before starting the restore, you should modify the ``CREATE TABLE`` statements in the dump files to include the |product_name| ``DISTRIBUTED`` clause. If you do not include the ``DISTRIBUTED`` clause, |product_name| assigns default values, which might not be optimal.

To perform a non-parallel restore using parallel backup files, you can copy the backup files from each segment host to the coordinator host, and then load them through the coordinator.

Another non-parallel method for backing up |product_name| data is to use the ``COPY TO`` SQL command to copy all or a portion of a table out of the database to a delimited text file on the coordinator host.

Backup and recovery with CBDR at the WAL level
-----------------------------------------------------------

CBDR is a backup and restore tool built on top of WAL-G, designed for |product_name|. It supports both full and incremental backups via the command line and is well suited for disaster recovery and long-term archival use cases.

Key features of CBDR include:

- **Full backup**: Supports full backup of the entire database cluster.
- **Incremental backup**: Captures only changes since the last backup based on WAL logs.
- **Restore point support**: Allows creating and restoring to named restore points for point-in-time recovery.
- **Backup listing and management**: Lists all full and incremental backups as well as restore points.
- **Storage support**: Supports S3-compatible object storage.
- **Compression options**: Supports lz4, lzma, zstd, and brotli compression algorithms.
- **Backup encryption**: Enables encryption of backup data.
- **Configuration management**: Automatically generates and manages required backup and restore configuration files.

For details of the CBDR tool, see the document :ref:`manage-system/backup-and-restore/cbdr:cbdr`.

.. tip::

   Compared to traditional tools like ``gpbackup`` and ``gprestore``, CBDR offers more flexible incremental backup capabilities and supports storing backup files in remote object storage, reducing reliance on local disk space. In addition, CBDR uses WAL-based physical backup and recovery, making it suitable for large-scale clusters and cross-region disaster recovery scenarios.
