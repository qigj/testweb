View SQL Monitoring Information
=================================

|monitor_console| provides monitoring information for in-progress and history SQL statements in the database. On the **Query Monitor** and **Query History** pages, you can see the execution status and details of each SQL statement,  and the status of each database session.

.. note:: 

   |monitor_console| currently doesn't support displaying information of the ``Prepare`` statements. 

Access the page
-----------------

To access the **Query Monitor** page, you need to:

1. Access the |monitor_console| dashboard in your browser via ``http://<cluster_node_IP>:8080/``.
2. Click **Query Monitor** in the left navigation menu to enter the page.

View SQL execution status
-----------------------------

To view the execution status of a SQL statement that is being executed, click the **Query Status** tab. You can view the information of history queries on **Query History**.

View in-progress SQL 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the execution status of an ongoing SQL statement, click on the **Query Execution Status** section.

.. note::
   
   You can pause or resume monitoring of in-progress query status by using the following commands:

   .. code:: sql

      psql gpperfmon -- Connect to the "gpperfmon" data warehouse.
      select query_state_pause(); -- Pause monitoring of ongoing queries. 
      select query_state_resume(); -- Resume monitoring of ongoing queries. 

In the search area, you can filter by the execution status of the SQL statement, user, and database. Click **Query** to search. The **User** filter supports multiple selections.

The options in the **Status** dropdown are described as follows:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{mytable-mid}

.. list-table:: 
   :align: left

   * - Option Name
     - Description
   * - Running
     - SQL statement is executing.
   * - Cancelling
     - SQL statement is being cancelled.
   * - Unknown
     - SQL statement execution status is unknown.

.. raw:: latex

   \end{mytable-mid}

After clicking **Query**, a list of SQL statements will be displayed in the area below.

View SQL Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the details of a specific SQL statement, click on the query ID of that SQL statement to enter the details page.

The details page displays information about the SQL execution, and you can click on different tabs to view the query plan diagram, SQL text, and query plan text. In the query plan diagram section, ongoing queries are dynamic, and the animation effect disappears once the query ends.

You can click on a module to view specific information, which updates automatically as the query progresses.

Example:

.. image:: /images/monitor-console-plan-details.png

In the **Query Plan Text** section, you can view the query plan information in text format.

.. note:: 

   In the **Query History** page, you can see SQL queries that took longer than a specific duration to execute. By default, the system records queries that take longer than 20 seconds. You can modify this value by changing the ``min_query_time`` parameter in the ``gpperfmon.conf`` configuration file on the Coordinator node. You can print the directory of this configuration file using ``echo $COORDINATOR_DATA_DIRECTORY``.

Cancel SQL execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To cancel one or more SQL statements, locate the **Operation** column of the corresponding SQL statement in the SQL list, and then click **Cancel Query**.

View session status
--------------------

To view session status in the database, click the **Session Status** tab on the **Query Monitor** page.

A list of real-time sessions running in the database is displayed, including session ID, execution status, the user who operates, the database where the session is running, the start time, the application, and idle time.

.. image:: /images/monitor-console-view-sql-monitor-info-5.png

To view the details of a session, in the search area, fill in the corresponding drop-down option box according to the execution status, user, database, and application name. Then click **Query** to search. The **User** box supports multiple selections.

The options in the **Status** drop-down box are described as follows:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{mytable-mid}

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Option name
     - Description
   * - Active
     - The backend is running the session.
   * - Idle
     - The backend is waiting for new client commands.
   * - Idle in transaction (aborted)
     - The backend is in a transaction, but currently, no query is running.
   * - Fastpath function call
     - The backend is executing the fast path function.
   * - Disabled
     - The status is reported when ``track_activities`` is disabled in the backend.
   * - Unknown
     - The session status is unknown.

.. raw:: latex

   \end{mytable-mid}

After clicking **Query**, a list of sessions is displayed in the area below, and you should be able to find the target session from the list.

By default, the session list is sorted by **Start Time** in descending order. You can click **Start Time** to sort in ascending order, or sort by **Idle Time**. The description of the fields in the list is as follows:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{mytable-mid}

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Option name
