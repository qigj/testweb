Manage Resources Using Resource Groups
======================================

You can use resource groups to manage and protect the resource allocation of CPU, memory, concurrent transaction limits, and disk I/O in |product_name|. Once you define a resource group, you assign the group to one or more |product_name| roles, or to an external component such as PL/Container, in order to control the resources used by them.

When you assign a resource group to a role, the resource limits that you define for the group apply to all of the roles to which you assign the group. For example, the memory limit for a resource group identifies the maximum memory usage for all running transactions submitted by |product_name| users in all roles to which you assign the group.

|product_name| uses Linux-based control groups for CPU resource management, and Runaway Detector for statistics, tracking and management of memory.

Role and component resource groups
--------------------------------------------------

|product_name| supports two types of resource groups: groups that manage resources for roles, and groups that manage resources for external components such as PL/Container.

The most common application for resource groups is to manage the number of active queries that different roles might run concurrently in your |product_name| cluster. You can also manage the amount of CPU, memory resources, and disk I/O that |product_name| allocates to each query.

When a user runs a query, |product_name| evaluates the query against a set of limits defined for the resource group. |product_name| runs the query immediately if the group's resource limits have not yet been reached and the query does not cause the group to exceed the concurrent transaction limit. If these conditions are not met, |product_name| queues the query. For example, if the maximum number of concurrent transactions for the resource group has already been reached, a subsequent query is queued and must wait until other queries complete before it runs. |product_name| might also run a pending query when the resource group's concurrency and memory limits are altered to large enough values.

Within a resource group for roles, transactions are evaluated on a first in, first out basis. |product_name| periodically assesses the active workload of the system, reallocating resources and starting/queuing jobs as necessary.

You can also use resource groups to manage the CPU and memory resources of external components such as PL/Container. Resource groups for external components use Linux cgroups to manage the total CPU resources for the component.

Resource group attributes and limits
--------------------------------------

When you create a resource group, you provide a set of limits that determine the amount of CPU and memory resources available to the group. The following table lists the available limits for resource groups:

     - Integer
     - 0

.. raw:: latex

   \end{mytable-mid}

.. note::

   Resource limits are not enforced on ``SET``, ``RESET``, and ``SHOW`` commands.

Transaction concurrency limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``CONCURRENCY`` limit controls the maximum number of concurrent transactions permitted for a resource group.

Each resource group is logically divided into a fixed number of slots equal to the ``CONCURRENCY`` limit. |product_name| allocates these slots an equal, fixed percentage of memory resources.

The default ``CONCURRENCY`` limit value for a resource group for roles is 20. A value of 0 means that no query is allowed to run for this resource group.

|product_name| queues any transactions submitted after the resource group reaches its ``CONCURRENCY`` limit. When a running transaction completes, |product_name| un-queues and runs the earliest queued transaction if sufficient memory resources exist. Note that if a transaction is in ``idle in transaction`` state, even if no statement is running, the concurrency slot is still in use.

You can set the server configuration parameter ``gp_resource_group_queuing_timeout`` to specify the amount of time a transaction remains in the queue before |product_name| cancels the transaction. The default timeout is zero, |product_name| queues transactions indefinitely.

Bypass limits and unassign from resource groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A query bypasses the resource group concurrency limit if you set the server configuration parameter ``gp_resource_group_bypass``. This parameter enables or disables the concurrent transaction limit for the resource group so a query can run immediately. The default value is false, which enforces the limit of the ``CONCURRENCY`` limit. You might only set this parameter for a single session, not within a transaction or a function. If you set ``gp_resource_group_bypass`` to true, the query no longer enforces the CPU or memory limits assigned to its resource group. Instead, the memory limit assigned to this query is ``statement_mem`` per query. If there is not enough memory to satisfy the memory allocation request, the query will fail.

You might bypass queries that only use catalog tables, such as the database Graphical User Interface (GUI) client, which runs catalog queries to obtain metadata. If the server configuration parameter ``gp_resource_group_bypass_catalog_query`` is set to true (the default), |product_name|'s resource group scheduler bypasses all queries that read exclusively from system catalogs, or queries that contain in their query text ``pg_catalog`` schema tables only. These queries are automatically unassigned from its current resource group; they do not enforce the limits of the resource group and do not account for resource usage. The query resources are assigned out of the resource groups and run immediately. The memory limit is ``statement_mem`` per the query.

You might bypass direct dispatch queries with the server configuration parameter ``gp_resource_group_bypass_direct_dispatch``. A direct dispatch query is a special type of query that only requires a single segment to participate in the execution. In order to improve efficiency, |product_name| optimizes this type of query, using direct dispatch optimization. The system sends the query plan to the execution of a single segment that needs to execute the plan, instead of sending it to all segments for execution. If you set ``gp_resource_group_bypass_direct_dispatch`` to true, the query no longer enforces the CPU or memory limits assigned to its resource group, so it runs immediately. Instead, the memory limit assigned to this query is ``statement_mem`` per query. If there is not enough memory to satisfy the memory allocation request, the query will fail. You might only set this parameter for a single session, not within a transaction or a function.

Queries whose plan cost is less than the limit ``MIN_COST`` are automatically unassigned from their resource group and do not enforce any of its limits. The resources used by the query do not account for the resources of the resource group. The query has a memory limit of ``statement_mem``. The default value of ``MIN_COST`` is 0.

CPU limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~

|product_name| leverages Linux control groups to implement CPU resource management. |product_name| allocates CPU resources in two ways:

* By assigning a percentage of CPU resources to resource groups
* By assigning specific CPU cores to resource groups

When you set one of the allocation modes for a resource group, |product_name| deactivates the other allocation mode. You might employ both modes of CPU resource allocation simultaneously for different resource groups on the same |product_name| cluster. You might also change the CPU resource allocation mode for a resource group at runtime. 

|product_name| uses the server configuration parameter ``gp_resource_group_cpu_limit`` to identify the maximum percentage of system CPU resources to allocate to resource groups on each |product_name| segment node. The remaining unreserved CPU resources are used for the operating system kernel and |product_name| daemons. The amount of CPU available to |product_name| queries per host is then divided equally among each segment on the |product_name| node. 

.. note::
   
   The default ``gp_resource_group_cpu_limit`` value might not leave sufficient CPU resources if you are running other workloads on your |product_name| cluster nodes, so be sure to adjust this server configuration parameter accordingly.


.. caution:: 
   
   Avoid setting ``gp_resource_group_cpu_limit`` to a value higher than .9. Doing so might result in high workload queries taking near all CPU resources, potentially starving |product_name| auxiliary processes.


Assign CPU resources by core
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You identify the CPU cores that you want to reserve for a resource group with the ``CPUSET`` property. The CPU cores that you specify must be available in the system and cannot overlap with any CPU cores that you reserved for other resource groups. Although |product_name| uses the cores that you assign to a resource group exclusively for that group, note that those CPU cores might also be used by non-|product_name| processes in the system. When you configure ``CPUSET`` for a resource group, |product_name| deactivates ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` and ``CPU_WEIGHT`` for the group and sets their value to -1.

Specify CPU cores separately for the coordinator host and segment hosts, separated by a semicolon. Use a comma-separated list of single core numbers or number intervals when you configure cores for ``CPUSET``. You must enclose the core numbers/intervals in single quotes, for example, ``'1;1,3-4'`` uses core 1 on the coordinator host, and cores 1, 3, and 4 on segment hosts.

When you assign CPU cores to ``CPUSET`` groups, consider the following:

-  A resource group that you create with ``CPUSET`` uses the specified cores exclusively. If there are no running queries in the group, the reserved cores are idle and cannot be used by queries in other resource groups. Consider minimizing the number of ``CPUSET`` groups to avoid wasting system CPU resources.
-  Consider keeping CPU core 0 unassigned. CPU core 0 is used as a fallback mechanism in the following cases:

   -  ``admin_group`` and ``default_group`` require at least one CPU core. When all CPU cores are reserved, |product_name| assigns CPU core 0 to these default groups. In this situation, the resource group to which you assigned CPU core 0 shares the core with ``admin_group`` and ``default_group``.
   -  If you restart your |product_name| cluster with one node replacement and the node does not have enough cores to service all ``CPUSET`` resource groups, the groups are automatically assigned CPU core 0 to avoid system start failure.

-  Use the lowest possible core numbers when you assign cores to resource groups. If you replace a |product_name| node and the new node has fewer CPU cores than the original, or if you back up the database and want to restore it on a cluster with nodes with fewer CPU cores, the operation might fail. For example, if your |product_name| cluster has 16 cores, assigning cores 1-7 is optimal. If you create a resource group and assign CPU core 9 to this group, database restore to an 8 core node will fail.

Resource groups that you configure with ``CPUSET`` have a higher priority on CPU resources. The maximum CPU resource usage percentage for all resource groups configured with ``CPUSET`` on a segment host is the number of CPU cores reserved divided by the number of all CPU cores, multiplied by 100.

.. note::

   You must configure ``CPUSET`` for a resource group *after* you have enabled resource group-based resource management for your |product_name| cluster with the ``gp_resource_manager`` server configuration parameter.

Assign CPU resources by percentage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You configure a resource group with ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` in order to assign CPU resources by percentage. When you configure ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` for a resource group, |product_name| deactivates ``CPUSET`` for the group.

The parameter ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` sets a hard upper limit for the percentage of the segment CPU for resource management. The minimum ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` percentage you can specify for a resource group is 1, the maximum is 100. The sum of ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT``\ s specified for all resource groups that you define in your |product_name| cluster can exceed 100. It specifies the total time ratio that all tasks in a resource group can run in a given CPU time period. Once the tasks in the resource group have used up all the time specified by the limit, they are throttled for the remainder of the time specified in that time period, and are not allowed to run until the next time period.

When tasks in a resource group are idle and not using any CPU time, the leftover time is collected in a global pool of unused CPU cycles. Other resource groups can borrow CPU cycles from this pool. The actual amount of CPU time available to a resource group might vary, depending on the number of resource groups present on the system.

The parameter ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` enforces a hard upper limit of CPU usage. For example, if it is set to 40%, it indicates that although the resource group can temporarily use some idle CPU resources from other groups, the maximum it can use is 40% of the CPU resources available to |product_name|.

You set the parameter ``CPU_WEIGHT`` to assign the scheduling priority of the current group. The default value is 100, and the range of values is 1 to 500. The value specifies the relative share of CPU time available to tasks in the resource group. For example, if one resource group has a relative share of 100 and another two groups have a relative share of 50, when processes in all the resource groups try to use 100% of the CPU (that means, the value of ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` for all groups is set to 100), the first resource group gets 50% of all CPU time, and the other two get 25% each. However, if you add another group with a relative share of 100, the first group is only allowed to use 33% of the CPU, and the remaining groups get 16.5%, 16.5%, and 33% respectively.

For example, consider the following groups:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{mytable-mid}

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Group Name
     - CONCURRENCY
     - CPU_MAX_PERCENT
     - CPU_WEIGHT
   * - default_group
     - 20
     - 50
     - 10
   * - admin_group
     - 10
     - 70
     - 30
   * - system_group
     - 10
     - 30
     - 10
   * - test
     - 10
     - 10
     - 10

.. raw:: latex

   \end{mytable-mid}

Roles in ``default_group`` have an available CPU ratio (determined by ``CPU_WEIGHT``) of 10/(10+30+10+10)=16%. This means that they can use at least 16% of the CPU when the system workload is high. When the system has idle CPU resources, they can use more resources, as the hard limit (set by ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT``) is 50%.

Roles in ``admin_group`` have an available CPU ratio of 30/(10+30+10+10)=50% when the system workload is high. When the system has idle CPU resources, they can use resources up to the hard limit of 70%.

Roles in ``test`` have a CPU ratio of 10/(10+30+10+10)=16%. However, as the hard limit determined by ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` is 10%, they can only use up to 10% of the resources even when the system is idle.

Memory limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you enable resource groups, memory usage is managed at the |product_name| segment and resource group levels. You can also manage memory at the transaction level.

The amount of memory allocated to a query is determined by the following parameters:

The parameter ``MEMORY_QUOTA`` of a resource group sets the maximum amount of memory reserved for this resource group on a segment. This determines the total amount of memory that all worker processes for a query can consume on the segment host during query execution. The amount of memory allotted to a query is the group memory limit divided by the group concurrency limit: ``MEMORY_QUOTA`` / ``CONCURRENCY``.

If a query requires a large amount of memory, you might use the server configuration parameter ``gp_resgroup_memory_query_fixed_mem`` to set a fixed memory amount for the query at the session level. This parameter overrides and can surpass the allocated memory of the resource group.

|product_name| allocates memory for an incoming query using the ``gp_resgroup_memory_query_fixed_mem`` value, if set, to bypass the resource group settings. Otherwise, it uses ``MEMORY_QUOTA`` / ``CONCURRENCY`` as the memory allocated for the query. If ``MEMORY_QUOTA`` is not set, the value for the query memory allocation defaults to ``statement_mem``.

For all queries, if there is not enough memory in the system, they spill to disk. When the limit ``gp_workfile_limit_files_per_query`` is reached, |product_name| generates an out of memory (OOM) error.

For example, consider a resource group named ``adhoc`` with ``MEMORY_QUOTA`` set to 1.5 GB and ``CONCURRENCY`` set to ``3``. By default, each statement submitted to the group is allocated 500 MB of memory. Now consider the following series of events:

1. User ``ADHOC_1`` submits query ``Q1``, overriding ``gp_resgroup_memory_query_fixed_mem`` to 800MB. The ``Q1`` statement is admitted into the system.

2. User ``ADHOC_2`` submits query ``Q2``, using the default 500MB.

3. With ``Q1`` and ``Q2`` still running, user ``ADHOC3`` submits query ``Q3``, using the default 500MB.

   Queries ``Q1`` and ``Q2`` have used 1300MB of the group's 1500MB. However, if there is enough system memory available for query ``Q3`` in the segment at that time, it can run normally.

4. User ``ADHOC4`` submits query ``Q4``, using ``gp_resgroup_memory_query_fixed_mem`` set to 700 MB.

   Query ``Q4`` runs immediately as it bypasses the resource group limits.

There are some special usage considerations regarding memory limits:

-  If the configuration parameters ``gp_resource_group_bypass`` or ``gp_resource_group_bypass_catalog_query`` are enabled to bypass resource group limits, the query's memory allocation will be determined by the value of ``statement_mem``.
-  When (``MEMORY_QUOTA`` / ``CONCURRENCY``) is less than ``statement_mem``, the system uses ``statement_mem`` as the fixed memory allocation for the query.
-  The maximum value of ``statement_mem`` is limited by ``max_statement_mem``.
-  If a query's planned cost is lower than the configured ``MIN_COST``, it will also be assigned memory based on ``statement_mem``.

Disk I/O limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|product_name| leverages Linux control groups to implement disk I/O limits. The parameter ``IO_LIMIT`` limits the maximum read/write disk I/O throughput, and the maximum read/write I/O operations per second for the queries assigned to a specific resource group. It allocates bandwidth, ensures the use of high-priority resource groups, and avoids excessive use of disk bandwidth. The value of the parameter is set on a per-tablespace basis.

.. note:: 

   Disk I/O limits are only available when you use Linux Control Groups v2.

When you limit disk I/O you specify:

-  The tablespace name or the tablespace object ID (OID) you set the limits for. Use ``*`` to set limits for all tablespaces.

-  The values for ``rbps`` and ``wbps`` to limit the maximum read and write disk I/O throughput in the resource group, in MB/sec. The default value is ``max``, which means there is no limit.

-  The values for ``riops`` and ``wiops`` to limit the maximum read and write I/O operations per second in the resource group. The default value is ``max``, which means there is no limit.

If the parameter ``IO_LIMIT`` is not set, the default value for ``rbps``, ``wpbs``, ``riops``, and ``wiops``\ s is set to ``max``, which means that there are no disk I/O limits. In this scenario, the ``gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_config`` system view displays its value as ``-1``. If only some of the values of ``IO_LIMIT`` are set (for example. ``rbps``), the parameters that are not set default to ``max`` (in this example, ``wbps``, ``riops``, ``wiops``).

Configure and use resource groups
-------------------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|product_name| resource groups use Linux Control Groups (cgroups) to manage CPU resources and disk I/O. There are two versions of cgroups: cgroup v1 and cgroup v2. |product_name| supports both versions, but it only supports the parameter ``IO_LIMIT`` for cgroup v2. The version of Linux Control Groups shipped by default with your Linux distribution depends on the operating system version. For Enterprise Linux 8 and older, the default version is v1. For Enterprise Linux 9 and later, the default version is v2.

Verify what version of cgroup is configured in your environment by checking what filesystem is mounted by default during system boot:

.. code:: bash

   stat -fc %T /sys/fs/cgroup/

For cgroup v1, the output is ``tmpfs``. For cgroup v2, output is
``cgroup2fs``.

You do not need to change your version of cgroup, you can simply skip to :ref:`optimize-performance/manage-resources-using-resource-groups:configure cgroup v1` or :ref:`optimize-performance/manage-resources-using-resource-groups:configure cgroup v2` in order to complete the configuration prerequisites. 

However, if you prefer to switch from cgroup v1 to v2, run the following commands as root:

.. note:: 

   -  If you are using an older version of CentOS, such as Centos 7.x or earlier, you will only be able to use the default ``cgroup v1`` control groups; if you are using Centos 8.x, you can follow the steps below to switch the control group from v1 to v2.
   -  Starting from v4.0.0, for ``cpu.pressure``, even when ``gp_resource_manager`` is set to ``group-v2``, |product_name| no longer checks the permissions or existence of the ``/proc/pressure/cpu`` interface. Therefore, the ``group-v2`` mode can still function properly as long as the kernel version is compatible, even if PSI (Pressure Stall Information) is not enabled.

-  Red Hat 8/Rocky 8/Oracle 8 systems:
  
   .. code:: bash

      grubby --update-kernel=/boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1"

-  Ubuntu systems:

   .. code:: bash

      vim /etc/default/grub     # add or modify: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1"     
      update-grub

If you want to switch from cgroup v2 to v1, run the following commands
as root:

-  Red Hat 8/Rocky 8/Oracle 8 systems:

   .. code:: bash

      grubby --update-kernel=/boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0 systemd.legacy_systemd_cgroup_controller"

-  Ubuntu systems:
  
   .. code:: bash

      vim /etc/default/grub     
      # add or modify: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"     
      update-grub

After that, reboot your host in order for the changes to take effect.

Configure cgroup v1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Complete the following tasks on each node in your |product_name| cluster to set up cgroups v1 for use with resource groups:

1. Install ``libcgroup`` and ``libcgroup-tools``:

   .. code:: bash

      sudo yum install libcgroup
      sudo yum install libcgroup-tools      

2. Locate the cgroups configuration file ``/etc/cgconfig.conf``. You must be the superuser or have ``sudo`` access to edit this file:

   .. code:: bash

      vi /etc/cgconfig.conf

3. Add the following configuration information to the file:

   .. code:: 

      group gpdb {
           perm {
               task {
                   uid = gpadmin;
                   gid = gpadmin;
               }
               admin {
                   uid = gpadmin;
                   gid = gpadmin;
               }
           }
           cpu {
           }
           cpuacct {
           }
           cpuset {
           }
           memory {
           }
      } 

   This content configures CPU, CPU accounting, CPU core set, and memory control groups managed by the ``gpadmin`` user. |product_name| uses the memory control group only for monitoring the memory usage.

4. Start the cgroups service on each |product_name| node. For Redhat/Oracle/Rocky 8.x and older, run the following as root:

   .. code:: bash

      cgconfigparser -l /etc/cgconfig.conf 

5. To automatically recreate |product_name| required cgroup hierarchies and parameters when your system is restarted, configure your system to enable the Linux cgroup service daemon ``cgconfig.service`` at node start-up. To ensure the configuration is persisten after reboot, run the following commands as user root. For Redhat/Oracle/Rocky 8.x and older:

   .. code:: bash

      systemctl enable cgconfig.service

   To start the service immediately (without having to reboot) enter:

   .. code:: bash

      systemctl start cgconfig.service

6. Identify the ``cgroup`` directory mount point for the node. For Redhat/Oracle/Rocky 8.x and older, run the following as root:

   .. code:: bash

      grep cgroup /proc/mounts

   The first line of output identifies the ``cgroup`` mount point.

7. Verify that you set up the |product_name| cgroups configuration correctly by running the following commands. Replace ``<cgroup_mount_point>`` with the mount point that you identified in the previous step:

   .. code:: bash

      ls -l <cgroup_mount_point>/cpu/gpdb
      ls -l <cgroup_mount_point>/cpuset/gpdb
      ls -l <cgroup_mount_point>/memory/gpdb

   If these directories exist and are owned by ``gpadmin:gpadmin``, you have successfully configured cgroups for |product_name| resource management.

Configure cgroup v2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Configure the system to mount ``cgroups-v2`` by default during system boot by the ``systemd`` system and service manager as user root.

   .. code:: bash 
      
      grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1"

2. Reboot the system for the changes to take effect. ``reboot now``

3. Create the directory ``/sys/fs/cgroup/gpdb``, add all the necessary controllers, and ensure ``gpadmin`` user has read and write permission on it.

   .. code-block:: shell

      mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/gpdb
      echo "+cpuset +io +cpu +memory" | tee -a /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control
      chown -R gpadmin:gpadmin /sys/fs/cgroup/gpdb

You might encounter the error ``Invalid argument`` after running the above commands. This is because cgroups v2 do not support control of real-time processes, and the ``cpu`` controller can only be enabled when all the real-time processes are in the root cgroup. In this situation, find all real-time processes and move them to the root cgroup before you re-enable the controllers.

1. Ensure that ``gpadmin`` has write permission on ``/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.procs``. This is required to move the |product_name| processes from the user slices to ``/sys/fs/cgroup/gpdb/`` after the cluster is started in order to manage the postmaster services and all its auxiliary processes.

   .. code:: bash

      chmod a+w /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.procs
      
   Because resource groups manually manage cgroup files, the above settings will become ineffective after a system reboot. Add the following bash script for systemd so it runs automatically during system startup. Perform the following steps as user root:

2. Create ``gpdb.service``.

   .. code:: bash
      
      vim /etc/systemd/system/gpdb.service 

3. Write the following content into ``gpdb.service``, if the user is not ``gpadmin``, replace it with the appropriate user.

   .. code:: bash

         [Unit]
         Description=|product_name| Cgroup v2 Configuration Service
         [Service]
         Type=simple
         WorkingDirectory=/sys/fs/cgroup/gpdb.service
         Delegate=yes
         Slice=-.slice

         # set hierarchies only if cgroup v2 mounted
         ExecCondition=bash -c '[ xcgroup2fs = x$(stat -fc "%%T" /sys/fs/cgroup) ] || exit 1'
         ExecStartPre=bash -ec " \
         chown -R gpadmin:gpadmin .; \
         chmod a+w ../cgroup.procs; \
         mkdir -p helper.scope"
         ExecStart=sleep infinity
         ExecStartPost=bash -ec "echo $MAINPID > ./helper.scope/cgroup.procs;"
         [Install]
         WantedBy=basic.target

4. Reload systemd daemon and enable the service:

   .. code:: bash
      
      systemctl daemon-reload
      systemctl enable gpdb.service

Enable resource groups
----------------------------

When you install |product_name|, no resource management policy is enabled by default. To use resource groups, set the ``gp_resource_manager`` server configuration parameter.

1. Set the ``gp_resource_manager`` server configuration parameter to the value ``"group"`` or ``"group-v2"``, depending on the version of cgroup configured on your Linux distribution. For example:

   .. code:: bash

      gpconfig -c gp_resource_manager -v "group"
      gpconfig -c gp_resource_manager -v "group-v2"

2. Restart |product_name|:

   .. code:: bash

      gpstop
      gpstart

Once enabled, any transaction submitted by a role is directed to the resource group assigned to the role, and is governed by that resource group's concurrency, memory, CPU, and disk I/O limits.

|product_name| creates three default resource groups for roles named ``admin_group``, ``default_group``, and ``system_group``. When you enable resources groups, any role that was not explicitly assigned a resource group is assigned the default group for the role's capability. ``SUPERUSER`` roles are assigned the ``admin_group``, non-admin roles are assigned the group named ``default_group``. The resources of the |product_name| system processes are assigned to the ``system_group``. You cannot manually assign any roles to the ``system_group``.

Use the following command to retrieve details of all the resource groups, including the default resource groups ``admin_group``, ``default_group``, and ``system_group``:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_config;

Create resource groups
----------------------------

When you create a resource group for a role, you provide a name and a CPU resource allocation mode (core or percentage). You can optionally provide a concurrent transaction limit, a memory limit, a CPU soft priority, disk I/O limits, and a minimum cost. Use the ``CREATE RESOURCE GROUP`` command to create a new resource group.

When you create a resource group for a role, you must provide a ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` or ``CPUSET`` limit value. These limits identify the percentage of |product_name| CPU resources to allocate to this resource group. You might specify a ``MEMORY_QUOTA`` to reserve a fixed amount of memory for the resource group.

For example, to create a resource group named *rgroup1* with a CPU limit of 20, a memory limit of 25, a CPU soft priority of 500, a minimum cost of 50, and disk I/O limits for the ``pg_default`` tablespace:

   .. code:: sql

      CREATE RESOURCE GROUP rgroup1 WITH (CONCURRENCY=20, CPU_MAX_PERCENT=20, MEMORY_QUOTA=250, CPU_WEIGHT=500, MIN_COST=50, 
      IO_LIMIT='pg_default: wbps=1000, rbps=1000, wiops=100, riops=100');

   .. note:: 

      If you use ``cgroup v1`` but specified IO_LIMIT. The resource group would still be created but with the following warning: "resource group io limit only can be used in cgroup v2". 

The CPU limit of 20 is shared by every role to which ``rgroup1`` is assigned. Similarly, the memory limit of 25 is shared by every role to which ``rgroup1`` is assigned. ``rgroup1`` utilizes the default ``CONCURRENCY`` setting of 20.

The ``ALTER RESOURCE GROUP`` command updates the limits of a resource group. To change the limits of a resource group, specify the new values that you want for the group. For example: 

   .. code:: sql

      ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg_role_light SET CONCURRENCY 7;
      ALTER RESOURCE GROUP exec SET MEMORY_QUOTA 30;
      ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rgroup1 SET CPUSET '1;2,4';
      ALTER RESOURCE GROUP sales SET IO_LIMIT 'tablespace1:wbps=2000,wiops=2000;tablespace2:rbps=2024,riops=2024'; 

.. note::
   
   You cannot set or alter the ``CONCURRENCY`` value for the ``admin_group`` to zero (0).

The ``DROP RESOURCE GROUP`` command drops a resource group. To drop a resource group for a role, the group cannot be assigned to any role, nor can there be any transactions active or waiting in the resource group.

To drop a resource group:

   .. code:: sql
      
      DROP RESOURCE GROUP exec; 


Configure automatic query termination based on memory usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------

|product_name| supports the Runaway detector, which automatically terminates queries based on the amount of memory used by the query. For resource group-managed queries, |product_name| terminates a running query based on the amount of memory used by the query. The relevant configuration parameters are:

-  ``gp_vmem_protect_limit`` sets the amount of memory that all ``postgres`` processes of the active segment instance can consume. If a query causes this limit to be exceeded, no memory will be allocated and the query will fail.

-  ``runaway_detector_activation_percent`` When resource groups are enabled, if the used memory exceeds the specified value ``gp_vmem_protect_limit`` \* ``runaway_detector_activation_percent``, |product_name| terminates queries based on memory usage, selecting queries from the queries managed by user resource groups (excluding those in the ``system_group`` resource group). |product_name| starts with the query that consumes the largest amount of memory. The query will terminate until the percentage of memory used falls below the specified percentage.

Assign a resource group to a role
------------------------------------

You assign a resource group to a database role using the ``RESOURCE GROUP`` clause of the ``CREATE ROLE`` or ``ALTER ROLE`` commands. If you do not specify a resource group for a role, the role is assigned the default group for the role's capability. ``SUPERUSER`` roles are assigned the ``admin_group``, non-admin roles are assigned the group named ``default_group``.

Use the ``ALTER ROLE`` or ``CREATE ROLE`` commands to assign a resource group to a role. For example:

.. code:: sql

   ALTER ROLE bill RESOURCE GROUP rg_light;
   CREATE ROLE mary RESOURCE GROUP exec;

You can assign a resource group to one or more roles. If you have defined a role hierarchy, assigning a resource group to a parent role does not propagate down to the members of that role group.

If you wish to remove a resource group assignment from a role and assign the role the default group, change the role's group name assignment to ``NONE``. For example:

.. code:: sql

   ALTER ROLE mary RESOURCE GROUP NONE;

Monitor resource group status
----------------------------------

Monitoring the status of your resource groups and queries might involve the following tasks.

View resource group limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_config`` system view displays the current limits for a resource group. To view the limits of all resource groups:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_config;

View resource group query status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_status`` system view enables you to view the status and activity of a resource group. The view displays the number of running and queued transactions. To view this information:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_status;

View resource group memory usage per host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_status_per_host`` system view enables you to view the real-time memory usage of a resource group on a per-host basis. To view this information:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_status_per_host;

View the resource group assigned to a role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the resource group-to-role assignments, perform the following query on the ``pg_roles`` and ``pg_resgroup`` system catalog tables:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT rolname, rsgname FROM pg_roles, pg_resgroup
   WHERE pg_roles.rolresgroup=pg_resgroup.oid;

View resource group disk I/O usage per host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gp_resgroup_iostats_per_host`` ``gp_toolkit`` system view enables you to view the real-time disk I/O usage of a resource group on a per-host basis. To view this information:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_iostats_per_host;

View a resource group's running and pending queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view a resource group's running queries, pending queries, and how long the pending queries have been queued, examine the ``pg_stat_activity`` system catalog table:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT query, rsgname,wait_event_type, wait_event 
   FROM pg_stat_activity;

``pg_stat_activity`` displays information about the user/role that initiated a query. A query that uses an external component such as PL/Container is composed of two parts: the query operator that runs in |product_name| and the UDF that runs in a PL/Container instance. |product_name| processes the query operators under the resource group assigned to the role that initiated the query. A UDF running in a PL/Container instance runs under the resource group assigned to the PL/Container runtime. The latter is not represented in the ``pg_stat_activity`` view; |product_name| does not have any insight into how external components such as PL/Container manage memory in running instances.

Cancel a running or queued transaction in a resource group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There might be cases when you want to cancel a running or queued transaction in a resource group. For example, you might want to remove a query that is waiting in the resource group queue but has not yet been run. Or, you might want to stop a running query that is taking too long to run, or one that is sitting idle in a transaction and taking up resource group transaction slots that are needed by other users.

By default, transactions can remain queued in a resource group indefinitely. If you want |product_name| to cancel a queued transaction after a specific amount of time, set the server configuration parameter ``gp_resource_group_queuing_timeout``. When this parameter is set to a value (milliseconds) greater than 0, |product_name| cancels any queued transaction when it has waited longer than the configured timeout.

To manually cancel a running or queued transaction, you must first determine the process id (pid) associated with the transaction. Once you have obtained the process id, you can invoke ``pg_cancel_backend()`` to end that process, as shown below.

For example, to view the process information associated with all statements currently active or waiting in all resource groups, run the following query. If the query returns no results, then there are no running or queued transactions in any resource group.

.. code:: sql

   SELECT rolname, g.rsgname, pid, waiting, state, query, datname 
   FROM pg_roles, gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_status g, pg_stat_activity 
   WHERE pg_roles.rolresgroup=g.groupid
   AND pg_stat_activity.usename=pg_roles.rolname;

Sample partial query output:

.. code:: sql

    rolname | rsgname  | pid     | waiting | state  |          query           | datname 
   ---------+----------+---------+---------+--------+------------------------ -+---------
     sammy  | rg_light |  31861  |    f    | idle   | SELECT * FROM mytesttbl; | testdb
     billy  | rg_light |  31905  |    t    | active | SELECT * FROM topten;    | testdb

Use this output to identify the process id (``pid``) of the transaction you want to cancel, and then cancel the process. For example, to cancel the pending query identified in the sample output above:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT pg_cancel_backend(31905);

You can provide an optional message in a second argument to ``pg_cancel_backend()`` to indicate to the user why the process was cancelled.

.. note:: 

   Do not use an operating system ``KILL`` command to cancel any |product_name| process.

Move a query to a different resource group
-----------------------------------------------

A user with |product_name| superuser privileges can run the ``gp_toolkit.pg_resgroup_move_query()`` function to move a running query from one resource group to another, without stopping the query. Use this function to expedite a long-running query by moving it to a resource group with a higher resource allotment or availability.

.. note:: 

   You can move only an active or running query to a new resource group. You cannot move a queued or pending query that is in an idle state due to concurrency or memory limits.

``pg_resgroup_move_query()`` requires the process id (pid) of the running query, as well as the name of the resource group to which you want to move the query. The signature of the function follows:

.. code:: sql

   pg_resgroup_move_query( pid int4, group_name text );

You can obtain the pid of a running query from the ``pg_stat_activity`` system view as described in :ref:`optimize-performance/manage-resources-using-resource-groups:cancel a running or queued transaction in a resource group`. Use the ``gp_toolkit.gp_resgroup_status`` view to list the name, id, and status of each resource group.

When you invoke ``pg_resgroup_move_query()``, the query is subject to the limits configured for the destination resource group:

-  If the group has already reached its concurrent task limit, |product_name| queues the query until a slot opens or for ``gp_resource_group_queuing_timeout`` milliseconds if set.
-  If the group has a free slot, ``pg_resgroup_move_query()`` tries to give slot control away to the target process for up to ``gp_resource_group_move_timeout`` milliseconds. If target process can't handle movement request until ``gp_resource_group_queuing_timeout`` exceeds, |product_name| returns the error: ``target process failed to move to a new group``.
-  If ``pg_resgroup_move_query()`` was cancelled, but target process already got all slot controls, segment's processes will not be moved to new group, and target process will hold the slot. Such inconsistent state will be fixed by the end of transaction or by any next command dispatched by target process inside same transaction.
-  If the destination resource group does not have enough memory available to service the query's current memory requirements, |product_name| returns the error: ``group <group_name> doesn't have enough memory ...``. In this situation, you might choose to increase the group shared memory allotted to the destination resource group, or perhaps wait a period of time for running queries to complete and then invoke the function again.

After |product_name| moves the query, there is no way to guarantee that a query currently running in the destination resource group does not exceed the group memory limit. In this situation, one or more running queries in the destination group might fail, including the moved query. Reserve enough resource group global shared memory to minimize the potential for this scenario to occur.

``pg_resgroup_move_query()`` moves only the specified query to the destination resource group. |product_name| assigns subsequent queries that you submit in the session to the original resource group.

Frequently asked questions
---------------------------

**Why is CPU usage lower than the ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` configured for the resource group?**

You might run into this situation when a low number of queries and slices are running in the resource group, and these processes are not utilizing all of the cores on the system.

My resource group has a ``CPU_WEIGHT`` equivalent to 40%. Why is the CPU usage never reaching this limit?

The value of ``CPU_MAX_PERCENT`` might be lower than 40, hence it might be limiting the CPU usage even with idle resources.

**Why is the number of running transactions lower than the ``CONCURRENCY`` limit configured for the resource group?**

|product_name| considers memory availability before running a transaction, and will queue the transaction if there is not enough memory available to serve it. If you use ``ALTER RESOURCE GROUP`` to increase the ``CONCURRENCY`` limit for a resource group but do not also adjust memory limits, currently running transactions might be consuming all allotted memory resources for the group. When in this state, |product_name| queues subsequent transactions in the resource group.

**Why is the number of running transactions in the resource group higher than the configured ``CONCURRENCY`` limit?**

This behaviour is expected. There are several reasons why this might happen:

-  Resource groups do not enforce resource restrictions on ``SET``, ``RESET`` and ``SHOW`` commands.
-  The server configuration parameter ``gp_resource_group_bypass`` disables the concurrent transaction limit for the resource group so a query can run immediately.
-  If the server configuration parameter ``gp_resource_group_bypass_catalog_query`` is set to true (the default), all queries that read exclusively from system catalogs, or queries that contain in their query text ``pg_catalog`` schema tables only will not enforce the limits of the resource group.
-  Queries whose plan cost is less than the limit ``MIN_COST`` will be automatically unassigned from their resource group and will not enforce any of the limits set for this.

**Why did my query return a “memory limit reached” error?**

|product_name| automatically adjusts transaction and group memory to the new settings when you use ``ALTER RESOURCE GROUP`` to change a resource group's memory and/or concurrency limits. An “out of memory” error might occur if you recently altered resource group attributes and there is no longer a sufficient amount of memory available for a currently running query.

**My query cannot run due to insufficient memory, resulting in memory leak Out of Memory (OOM).**

First, ensure that the resource group is allocating enough memory required by the query by tuning resource group parameters such as ``CONCURRENCY`` and ``MEMORY_QUOTA``. Analyze the type of query, whether there will be a lot of intermediate results using memory. If it does exist, you can set a reasonable ``gp_resgroup_memory_query_fixed_mem`` to allocate more memory at the session level for this specific query.

**After a memory leak OOM the system has a high concurrent load**.

When the system starts to clean up the sessions left over by the memory leak, the concurrent load of the system is high at this time, and the OOM error message might reappear. Due to the current design, we cannot expedite the cleanup process of the Runaway Session. The solution to this problem is to adjust the ``runaway_detector_activation_percent`` to 0.85 or 0.8, or even lower, in order to increase the available memory of the segment host.

**Some transaction requests only run during a certain period of time, and do not run at other times.**

You might change the configuration of resource groups can be changed dynamically at regular intervals to match the requirements of your workload, and customize resource allocation at different times to achieve higher efficiency. For example, change the configuration of resources within a group, add or delete resource groups.
