Basic Query Syntax
==================

This document introduces basic queries in |product_name|.

|product_name| is a high-performance, highly parallel data warehouse developed based on PostgreSQL and Greenplum. The following are some examples of basic query syntax.

-  ``SELECT``: Used to retrieve data from databases and tables.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT * FROM employees;  -- Query all data from the employees table.

-  Conditional queries (``WHERE``): Filter result sets based on specific conditions.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;  -- Query employee information with salaries exceeding 50,000.

-  ``ORDER BY``: Used to sort query results by one or more columns.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;  -- Sort employee information by salary in descending order.

-  Aggregate functions: Used to calculate statistical information from data sets, such as ``COUNT``, ``SUM``, ``AVG``, ``MAX``, ``MIN``.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;  -- Calculate the average salary of employees.

-  ``GROUP BY``: Used with aggregate functions to specify column information for group aggregation.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;  -- Count the number of employees by department.

-  Limiting result quantity (``LIMIT``): Used to limit the number of rows returned by query results.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;  -- Query only the first 10 employees' information.

-  Join queries (``JOIN``): Used to combine data from two or more tables based on related columns.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
      FROM employees 
      JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;  -- Query employees and their corresponding department names.

-  Subqueries: Nested queries within another SQL query.

   .. code:: sql

      SELECT name FROM employees 
      WHERE department_id IN (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');  -- Query all employees working in New York.

The above is just a brief overview of basic query syntax in |product_name|. |product_name| also provides more advanced queries and features to help developers perform complex data operations and analysis.
